// The ChiSquareFilter class implements a Chi-Square histogram difference algorithm
// that can be parallelized over the GPU using custom CIKernels.
// The algorithm is a parallel implementation of the ChiSquare difference algorithm of OpenCV.
// http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/histograms/histogram_comparison/histogram_comparison.html
//
// It's parallleized over the GPU by using two CIKernels, that do the following.
// 1. Computes the absolute squared difference to expected value ratio.
// 2. A summation of of the histogram differences over across the histogram bin range.
//
// The expected value is the histogram image that you want to match against.  The training image
// should be considered the histogram image from a training set.  Both images must be compatible
// with one another (equal in block dimensions and number of bins per block).
//
// The spatial layout of the memory histogram image is as follows.
// [0][1]   for a 2x2 histogram image. memory buffer: [0][1][2][3].
// [2][3]                              where each [] is the histogram of floats, each n bins.
//
// However, note that the CoreImage coordinate space is (0, 0) at bottom left corner.
// This means that in the kernel, it will be operating the space as follows.
// [2][3]
// [0][1]
//
// This is perfectly fine as the kernel only operates on the x parameter which maintains the same change
// pattern as the how the data is structured.
//
//
// Since each histogram image is equal in bins, data type size, and block dimensions, they are easily parallelizable on
// the graphics hardware.  Each value is independent of one another, so as long as we understand the dimensions of each
// histogram and stay within their respective regions, we can easily parallelize the computation. Sweet deal.
//
//
// Kernel algorithms.
// Absolute square difference to expected ratio kernel.
// ((expectHisto[i] - trainingHisto[i])^2) / expectHisto[i].
//
// Histogram summation kernel.
// The previous kernel was simpler because it didn't have to be cognizant of region space.
// The summation filter has to ensure that it's only summing across the range of the current
// histogram bins.  It must determine that it's looking at the first bin in a histogram and
// if so return the output as the summation of it and rest of the bins in the range of the
// histogram.  Zero (0) should be output for the rest of the pixels in the histogram.
//
// So the algorthm looks like.
// if ( destCoord().x % binCount == 0 )
//    end = destCoord.x + binCount;
//    for ( x = destCoord.x; x < end; x++ )
