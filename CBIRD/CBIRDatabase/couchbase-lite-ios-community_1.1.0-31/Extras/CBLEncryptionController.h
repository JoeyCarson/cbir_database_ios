/** Creates or opens an encrypted Couchbase Lite database, including all needed user interaction. (Note: database encryption is supported only if you build your app with SQLCipher, instead of
    the system-supplied libSQLite.dylib.)
    Due to the need for user interaction, the API is asynchronous.
    * If the database does not exist, the user will be prompted to make up a password, and the
      database will be created and encrypted with that password.
    * If the database already exists and is not encrypted, it's opened immediately.
    * If the database already exists, and is encrypted, the user will be prompted to enter the
      password. An arbitrary number of retries are allowed, but only at two-second intervals.
    * If the device supports Touch ID, password entry is skipped in favor of storing a
      raw key (256 random bits) in a Keychain entry protected (encrypted) by Touch ID. The user 
      will be prompted to to authenticate via Touch ID when opening the database.
    The password entry UI is localizable (see comments in the source code) but pretty minimal, using
    UIAlertController. It can be replaced entirely by overriding -askForPasswordWithPrompt:. */

    use it. 
    Setting this property to YES is pointless (it will not cause your iPhone to grow a
    Touch ID sensor!)
    Setting it to NO is discouraged unless you are _very_ paranoid about security. Touch ID
    verification is hackable, but requires specialized techniques like acquiring fingerprints and
    making silicone replicas of them. In practice TouchID is going to provide stronger security
    than the sort of weak passcode a user will end up using on a mobile app. */
